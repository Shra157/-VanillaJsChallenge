        <p>The Jenu Kurubas, primary inhabitants of this forest area, are a tribe in Karnataka state and their
            traditional practices and rituals are slowly disappearing. The government is restricting their entry inside
            the National park and forest due to multiple factors including but not limited conservation efforts and
            bringing the community to the mainstream society.

            The Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, identified the Jenu Kuruba and the Koraga as tribal
            groups in Karnataka. The Jenu Kurubas are traditional food gatherers and honey collectors. In Kannada, the
            term 'Jenu' means 'honey' and the term 'kuruba' generally mean 'shepherd'. It is derived from the Kannada
            word 'kuri' which means 'sheep'. The term kuruba is also associated with non-shepherd communities. They
            speak a variant form of Kannada commonly known as Jenu-nudi within their family kin group, and Kannada with
            others. They use Kannada script. According to the Census of 1981, the population of Jenu Kuruba community is
            34,747 out of which 17,867 are male and 16,880 are female.[8]

            The Jenu Kurubas are found scattered in the jungles as with other tribal groups. They are excellent climbers
            of tree and are skilled in the use of sling, bows and arrows.
